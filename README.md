# Autonomous-buggy
ARM-based STM32F401 Code for autonomous Buggy 
Leveraging the power of an ARM-based STM32F401 microcontroller on Keil Studio, we successfully implemented line-following algorithms, overcoming numerous challenges along the way.
Throughout this project, I covered the entire product life cycle:
System Design: Led the design and development of both software and hardware components.
Sensor Selection: Coordinated tests on various sensors, ultimately selecting the TCRT 5000 sensor based on data and practicality.
Hardware Construction: Directed the construction of hardware components in CAD and performed stress and strain tests.
Our project also involved developing advanced control algorithms and remote control functionality:
Sensor Array and Control: Designed and engineered a 5-sensor array using Altium software, implementing object-oriented programming concepts and the weighted average algorithm.
Navigation Control: Developed a two-layer cascaded control loop, utilizing MATLAB to determine control values.
Remote Control: Integrated Bluetooth for remote control, using serial byte values for controlled stop, line following, and 360-degree turn commands.
